## Clock Problem - 20 Minutes into the Future

Note the current time and what it would look like on an analog clock. Determine what angle the
minute hand and the hour hand would form 20 minutes from now. State any assumptions you
make along with your solution.

Result: 

* The clock show the time of 03:00, so the initial angle is 90 degrees.
* 20 minuts has pass, and the clock should show 03:20. So the angle whould be:
  * 1/3 of 90 degress, wich is the same as 30 degrees.
